# Identifying Viable Long-Term Investment Opportunities 

<p> Inflation arises when a basket of goods and services increase in price over time. For example, the amount required to buy a cell phone today may only best afford a calculator twenty years later. Money that is not reinvested sits depreciating in your pocket. Inflation is inevitable, yet defensible by us if due investment choices are made. These choices may be constituted along the way when we examine a company’s “report card”, also known as the financial statements summarizing its earning power, reserving ability, and flexibility with free cash. To do this, many financial metrics are used to evaluate how investors are treated for any company based on its “report card”. If the investors are treated well in the long-term, then the company would be a viable choice for investment, otherwise, cautions should be taken when committing to the company’s stock. This method of filtering out viable investments works because the metrics used guarantee a selected business to have a durable outlook, that is high prospects for its return to sufficiently offset the inflated prices in a long-term future. Such stock selection synergizes with the compounding power of its growth throughout the years, and before you notice, it will be your investment inflating rather than the economy.  </p>
